Golden **wire vectors** — canonical NCP message instances every language peer must
round-trip. This directory is the cross-language interop contract: a divergence in any
binding's wire handling fails CI here, not in a downstream integration.

NCP is one normative protocol (`proto/ncp.proto`) with peers in Rust, Python, TypeScript,
and C++. `conformance/vectors/` holds one canonical instance per message `kind` plus the
binary bulk-codec block, so every peer can prove it agrees on the *same* bytes.

The corpus has two complementary axes. `vectors/` pins the **wire shape** — do the
peers agree on the same *bytes*. `behavior/` pins **runtime behavior** — do the peers
make the same *decisions* (version accept/reject, advisory contract status, validation,
the safety-governor HOLD/ESTOP/clamp outcomes). A peer can serialize the right bytes and
still mis-decide; the two axes together close that gap.

## What's here

```text
vectors/*.json        one canonical instance per message kind (open_session, capabilities, …)
vectors/*.bin         packed little-endian bulk column block(s) (bulk_observation.bin)
behavior/vectors.json language-neutral {function, input, expect} decision vectors
```

## How the peers consume it (wire shape — `vectors/`)

- **Python** — `scripts/check_conformance_vectors.py` validates every `*.json` against
  the schema for its `kind` (field-set + required + enum, resolving local `$ref`/`$defs`)
  and decodes each `*.bin` against its expected columns. Stdlib-only; also gates corpus
  coverage (every schema `kind` must have a vector).
- **C++** — `ncp-cpp/tests/corpus.rs` drives every `*.json` through the C ABI
  `ncp_validate` and asserts accept/reject parity.
- **Rust** — `ncp-core/tests/conformance.rs` guards serde `<->` JSON Schema field-set
  parity type-side; the Rust bulk encoder is byte-pinned to the committed `*.bin`
  (`bulk::tests::matches_committed_golden_vector`).
- **TypeScript** — the `ncp-ts` peer validates the same vectors against the generated
  schemas (see `ncp-ts/`).

## How the peers consume it (behavior — `behavior/vectors.json`)

All four SDK peers replay the SAME corpus, so a divergence in any one peer's decision
logic fails CI here:

- **Rust** — `ncp-core/tests/behavior_conformance.rs` drives every vector through the
  real `ncp_core` functions and asserts the declared outcome, so the corpus can never
  claim a decision the reference does not make. Gates in CI via `cargo test`.
- **C++** — `ncp-cpp/tests/behavior_corpus.rs` drives the full corpus through the C ABI
  (`ncp_check_version` / `ncp_contract_status` / `ncp_validate` / `ncp_govern`). Gates
  in CI via `cargo test`.
- **Python** — `scripts/check_behavior_vectors.py` replays the identical corpus through
  the `ncp` PyO3 binding. It skips with exit 0 when the binding is not built (maturin is
  not yet in CI — see `ROADMAP.md`); the Rust/C++ halves gate regardless.
- **TypeScript** — `ncp-ts/scripts/check-behavior.mjs` replays the subset the thin
  client implements — `checkVersion`, `contractStatus`, and the scientific-boundary
  discriminators — and fail-loud-lists `govern` + required-field `validate` as
  out-of-scope (owned by the full peers). Gates in the `ts-dist` CI job.

Run the whole matrix with `scripts/check.sh` (it invokes `check_conformance_vectors.py`
for the wire vectors and `check_behavior_vectors.py` for the behavioral corpus).
